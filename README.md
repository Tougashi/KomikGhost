## About Komik Ghost

The E-Comic application is created to provide a more interactive and practical comic reading experience through a web platform. Its main goal is to leverage the advancements in digital technology to present comic content innovatively, catering to the needs of modern readers and supporting progress in the digital comic industry. The application is designed with the aim of creating an engaging, educational, and trend-aligned reading experience. Therefore, E-Comic has opened new opportunities in creating a more interactive and compelling reading experience.

However, with the rapid growth of the digital comic industry, the demand for a web application that allows readers to enjoy e-comics in a more practical and engaging manner is increasing. Hence, it is essential to understand the latest trends and innovations in the digital comic industry and contribute to the development of a web application that can meet the needs of modern digital comic readers.

With this background, I feel increasingly motivated to navigate and understand my role in the ever-evolving world of digital comics. This E-Comic web application is specifically dedicated to "Western" comics such as DC & Marvel. This decision is made considering the rarity of platforms that provide web comics for Western comics, as the Indonesian market still predominantly offers comics from Japan or Korea. Therefore, the Ghost Comic is created to address this gap
